								<!-- many examples to div's and span's with id and class using my favourite tv-series kitt -->
								<!-- the text is from Wikipedia -->
								KITT is the short name of two fictional characters from the adventure TV series Knight Rider. 
								While having the same acronym, the KITTs are two different entities: one known as the Knight Industries Two Thousand, which appeared in the original TV series Knight Rider, 
								and the other as the Knight Industries Three Thousand, which appeared first in the two-hour 2008 pilot film for a new Knight Rider TV series and then the new series itself. 		
								<div class="secret code1 code2">						
								<p>
									In both instances, KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module in the body of a highly advanced, very mobile, robotic automobile:
									the original KITT as a 1982 Pontiac Trans Am, and the second KITT as a 2008-2009 Ford Shelby GT500KR.
									In the television show's history, the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) was said to have been designed by the late Wilton Knight, a brilliant but eccentric 
									billionaire and founder of the Foundation for Law And Government (FLAG) and its parent Knight Industries. The 2008 pilot movie later implied that Charles Graiman, 
									creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand, also had a hand in designing the first KITT.
								</p>
								<div class="secret code1 code2 code3">	
										<span class="span-code">According to the series, the original KITT's main cybernetic processor was first installed in a mainframe computer used by the United States government in Washington, 
										D.C. However, Wilton saw better use for "him" in the Foundation's crime-fighting crusade and eventually the system was installed in the vehicle.</span> KITT was in fact the second 
										vehicle built by Knight Industries with artificial intelligence.<div id="kitt">His predecessor was KARR, the Knight Automated Roving Robot. KARR was programmed for self-preservation, but this proved 
										to be dangerous to the Foundation's humanitarian interests. KARR was later deactivated and placed in storage while KITT was given to his new operator, Michael Knight (the new identity of Michael Arthur Long). 
										KARR was later unwittingly reactivated by thieves in the original episode "Trust Doesn't Rust", was thought destroyed, then reappeared in the episode "K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R" and was seen to be finally destroyed by Michael and KITT.
										</div>
										While the 2008 pilot movie and then the new series appears to be a revamp of the original series, it offers some continuity from the original TV series Knight Rider
										<span class="span-code">The 'new' or 'second' KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is a different vehicle and microprocessor unit, and its driver is not the first Michael Knight, but his son, Mike Traceur, who eventually assumes the same title.</span>
										The original Michael Knight makes an appearance in the 2008 pilot movie, verifying that he is the father of Mike Traceur, and is described as having driven 'the first KITT'. 
								</div>					
									<p>
										The original physical incarnation of the Knight Industries Two Thousand is also shown in the pilot movie (although in pieces) in the scene where the garage of Charles Graiman
										(creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand and implied co-designer of the original KITT) is searched by antagonists. A Trans-Am body (sans-hood) is partially covered by a tarp, on which rests the rear spoiler. 
									</p>
								</div>							
									<p>
										The famous KITT steering wheel (labelled "Knight Two Thousand") and "KNIGHT" license plate are also shown, along with numerous black car body parts. When the camera shows a full scene of the garage, 
										there are three cars in the garage: the 3000, a 2000 under a tarp and a 2000 without any of the parts missing.

					<p>	
						When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a <em><b>Document Object Model</b></em> of the page.<br>
						The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows
						programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>
						<!-- an explanation about some points to HTML and the box-model -->
						All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term <b><em>"box model"</em></b> is used when talking about design and layout.<br>
						The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.<br>
						The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.<br>
						The image below illustrates the box model:<br><br>
					</p>
						<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="images/CSSBoxModel.jpg" alt="" ></div>
						<div>
							<p>Explanation of the different parts:<br>
								Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear<br>
								Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent<br>
								Border - A border that goes around the padding and content<br>
								Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent<br>
								Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear<br>
								Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent<br>
								Border - A border that goes around the padding and content<br>
								Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent<br>

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>
						<!-- some explanations about avoiding repetions -->
						Avoiding repetition is an important issue for several reasons. 
						When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often do the same thing again and again. This means copy and past certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code. This can cause many problems when a programmer decides to change something in the code. So programmers have to think first sophisticated and then to program efficient. The code will be costistent.
						For example, I wanted every part in this page to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I assigned each part div the same class attributes and then specified the style for that class in only one place.

					In this second introductory project we got an idea about the following terms.<br>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML Elements DIV and Span: Most HTML elements are defined as block level elements or inline elements.</li>	
					
						<li>HTML Tree-Like Structure: It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.</li>		
								
						<li>HTML and CSS: CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>Styling can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways: inline, internal, external</li>
		
						<li>Programming Text Editors: These editors make the programmer's life easier.</li>
